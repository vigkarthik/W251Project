Roles and responsibilities
Team's preferred communication method:

For quick responses, we will use text messaging. For long detailed planning, we will use email. 

Team's preferred meeting times and frequency:

Meetings: Thursdays before assignments due, and email check-in Sun/Mon to finalize

Team's preferred method for tracking progress:

Track progress through GitHub but also with text messaging to check in if one person is currently working on something to avoid merge conflicts due to more than one working on the same thing at the same time.

Point person for contacting course facilitators with questions:

By rotational basis. We have a table that tracks each person's responsibilities for each milestone for contacting facilitators, notetaker, support check ins, and assignment submission. Anything in between, we will check in with each other via text and clearly communicate who is going to ask certain questions in addition to the milestone assignments.
