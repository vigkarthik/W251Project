## Introduction

To create better county-level health measures to decrease acute asthma cases, an analysis of the California Health and Human Service (CHHS) Department data (2020) for asthma emergency department visits based on various demographic and geographic measures alongside the CalEnviroScreen (CES) 4.0 scores (2021) was conducted with the assistance of data from the California Census.

## Problem Statement

This specific analysis aims to evaluate the relationship between county asthma emergency department rates and CES scores as well as the relationship between county asthma ED visit rates, ED visit counts, pollution burden, housing burden, and race (i.e. if there are existing racial health disparities observed).

## Methods

To assess the relationship between county asthma emergency department (ED) rates and CES scores, age, and race, the project team used CHHS' Asthma ED Visit Rates by county and CES' measures and scores datasets. The asthma dataset was segmented by county while the CES dataset was by census tract, so we averaged a county's census tracts into one county-level measure for further analysis (**Endnote 1**). Then, we merged all datasets. To compare counties, we calculated a CES weighted average using the individual county CES scores and each county's population. We then made a table that listed the county CES score and percent of the weighted state score (**Endnote 2**). To ease visualization for all of our tables, we limited the rows to Bay Area counties. There were several Not Available or "NA" values in all three datasets and these were recoded to zeroes.

To assess asthma-related age differences, we used the "Child vs. adult" strata in the asthma dataset with the county name, age group, and age-adjusted ED visit rate. We plotted county-level raw numbers of ED visits for Children and Adults on a boxplot.

For the race data, we took the original Asthma ED Visit Rates by County dataset and filtered them into individual datasets, each describing all-ages age-adjusted ED visit rate by race. Since these datasets were in long format, we pivoted them into a wider format and to a single table describing age-adjusted ED visit rates and counts. We also made a histogram using the sum of asthma ED visit numbers by race.Â 

At this point, all datasets were processed into their respective strata of interest and all at the county level. We also included Pollution Burden and Housing Burden as socioeconomic variables from the CES datasets.

## Results

Three county-level tables were generated using California asthma and CES data. To simplify the discussion, tables (**Tables 1A-C**) focused on the nine Bay Area counties were generated (**Endnote 3**).Â 

**Table 1A** looks at age-adjusted asthma ED visit rates for all ages for each county, stratified by race. Notably, there are several zeroes in this table in the Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander and American Indian/Alaskan Native columns. We see that non-White, non-Asian/Pacific Islander racial groups have higher age-adjusted ED visit rates across all nine Bay Area counties.Â 

**Table 1B** summarizes the age-adjusted ED rates by age, and while the difference between adults and children appears minimal, the differences between counties are much more notable. Solano stands out with the rates amongst both age groups and Marin has the lowest. Solano rates are significantly higher than the next highest county (Contra Costa), with the remaining counties being fairly similar.Â 

In **Table 1C**, assessment for Pollution Burden scores and Housing Burden % as proxies for environmental hazards at the county levels was conducted alongside CES scores. Marin and Sonoma counties had better CES Scores and a lower pollution burden but have a higher percentage of their population housing burdened. Napa had the median CES score but also had the lowest housing burden. Solano has the worst CES score in the Bay Area and is in the upper quartile of housing burden. Alameda and Contra Costa have similar scores across all three metrics.

Putting all three tables together, there appears to be significant variation in age-adjusted asthma ED visit rates across counties and racial categories.Â 

**Chart 1** is a scatterplot of a regression that aims to identify the relationship between CES 4.0 Score and Adult Asthma ED Visit Rates to help identify any patterns between pollution and asthma visits (**Endnote 4**). There appears to be a slight positive relationship between CES score and adult asthma visit rates: counties that are measured to have higher environmental and socioeconomic burdens are associated with increased adult asthma ED visits.

**Chart 2** is a bar graph that compares the number of ED visits due to asthma between different race groups across all California counties. Based on the comparison chart, the race that appears to be disproportionately affected by asthma to the point of requiring emergency department visits are Hispanic residents, followed by Black. However, this bar graph does not take into consideration the proportions of each race per county.

## Discussion

Our analysis of California race and asthma ED visit rates shows that the burden of severe asthma disproportionately falls on Communities of Color, with the rates among Black residents almost 5 times as high as those of White residents. However, as California has a significant proportion of Hispanic residents, the Hispanic category makes up the highest number of ED visits by count. Adult and child asthma ED visit rates are similar within counties (i.e. if one is high then the other is similarly high) but differ compared to other counties. Pollution Burden and Housing Burden varied greatly across counties, with no obvious trends when compared to other variables of interest, but worse CES scores as a whole are associated with more asthma-related visits. Further analysis can be done to determine which other socioeconomic or environmental measures are linked to asthma-impacted communities.

We hope these visualizations will help start discussions of the relationships between asthma and environmental or socioeconomic factors, though gaps in knowledge remain. After further adjustments and research, we hope that our findings can be used to inform asthma-related public health interventions in California and reduce health disparities among age, race, and socioeconomic factors. To make a meaningful impact on the health of Californians with asthma, interventions should be evidence-based and tailored to help the populations (e.g., Communities of Color) experiencing the highest burdens.

## Endnotes

**Endnote 1:** The asthma dataset was segmented by county while the CES dataset was by census tract, so we used the "group" and "summarize" (using the mean) functions to group a county's census tracts into one county-level measure for further analysis.

**Endnote 2:** Though not included in our main analysis,we made a table named **kable_ces_diff** that listed county CES score and percent of the weighted state score (100%+ meaning worse than the state average and \<100% meaning better than the state average).

**Endnote 3:** **Table 1A-C** is meant to be presented as one full table, but has been broken up into three parts for print readability.

**Endnote 4:** A regression line has been included in **Chart 1**, with the gray shaded area depicting the 95% confidence level of the regression model.
